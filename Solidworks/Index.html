    <span>Scanning Tunneling Microscope enclosure (March 2020)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/NEdeginday.JPG" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p>As part of my Nanotechnology Engineering design day, there was a CAD compenent to recreate your model on Solidworks
         and create models to use to laser cut.  </p>

  <span>CO2 release (February 2020)</span>
  <br>
      <img src="Image/Fast_edited.jpg" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p> This is a remote controled CO2 release with-in the rocket. This was a collaberated effort in the Mechanical team, 
        I worked on modifing it to be easy to machine, as well as producing the valve. </p>

  <li align="justify"  class="info">
    <span>Soapcart</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Soapcart.jpg" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p>This is was the final project for the NE100 class. This was a group effort to make a functioning soapcart 
        using all of our solidworks knowledge and to encourage us to use the solidworks Library and practice group work. 
        My group wanted to be creative and make a dome-like cart and make it into a famous cute character known for their roundness.</p>

    <span>Wooden Vase (November 2020)</span>
      <br>
      <img src="Image/Vase.JPG" width="400px">
    <br>
      <p>I built this to learn how to create fun patterns. </p>

      <span>Valve (February 2020)</span>
        <br>
        <img src="Image/Valve.jpg" width="400px">
      <br>
        <p>While reverse engineering a valve I was given to help with my Design Team's Solidworks project I practiced using the metal lofting tool.  </p>
  
      </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Airplane (January 2020) </span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/airplane.jpg" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p>While modeling the Airplane I practiced using images in the Software to make an acurate shape.   </p>
  </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
  <span>Syringe (January 2020) </span>
  <br>
      <img src="Image/Syringe.jpg" width ="200px">
  <br> 
      <p>Fun project to try a syringe. Inspired by the amount of medical school youtube videos being recommened.</p>
  </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
 <span> RLCS towerside CAD (July 2020) </span>
 <br>
      <img src="Image/RCLS.png" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p>This is a CAD model of the RLCS (rocket launch control system) that would be placed on the towerside of the rocket during competition.</p>
  </li> 
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Trampoline (November 2019)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Trampoline.jpg" width="400px">
      <p>The trampoline was an assignmet to improve our Engineering Design and to familiarize our self to Solidwork's assembly.
        This project strengthened my mating, assembly, and 3D designing skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Newton's craidel (October 2019)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Newt_edited.jpg" width="400px">
    <br>
      <p>Utalizing the motion simulation in SolidWorks the Newtop Cradel model moves like the real thing.
        An animation was also set-up to watch the simuation.</p>
  </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Spring Attachment (October 2019)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Spring_attatchment_edited.jpg" width="400px">
      <br>
      <p>As a way to practice using mates and appearences, springs and a block were mated. 
        This assignment was made to give us the tools that would later on help during Nanotechnology Engineering design day.</p>

    <span>MEMS microgripper (October 2019)</span><br>

   https://www.researchgate.net/figure/MEMS-microgripper-with-integrated-two-axis-force-sensors_fig1_23480244</a><br>
  unfortunatly I lost my CAD desgin, but the project was to mimic the MEMs microgripper butin a much simpler desgin using our
   knowledge of making gears and making a functioning gripper that is maximum of 2cm by 2cm.
</li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Chair (September 2019)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Chair_edited.jpg" width="400px">
    <br>
      <p>For our first assignment we had to create a chair. 
        I wanted to be creative and go beyond the skills that were taught in class by adding appearences such as material and color,
         and playing with different shapes not normally found for a chair.</p>
  </li>
  <li align="justify" class="info">
    <span>Gear (October 2019) </span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/Gear.jpg" width="75px">
    <br>
      <p>I learned how to create a gear from scratch. While we did learn to use the Solidworks library we were 
        taught to make a gear from scratch incase if we wanted customizable tools </p>

  <li align ="justify" class="info">
    <span>Spring (November 2019)</span>
    <br>
      <img src="Image/spring.jpg" width="50px">
    <br>
      <p>Another useful skill gained from class projects is making a spring from scratch.
        This taught me how to manipulate planes and sketches beyond the defult planes, which really benifited me in later projects.</p>

My name is <b>Nadine Arar</b>,

and I am a <b>Nanotechnology Engineering</b> student 

from <b>the University of Waterloo</b>. 


<b>What is Nanotechnology Engineering? you may ask...</b>

It is the study of how to utilize and manipulate materials and devices in the nanoscale

(how cool is that!). Think of it as a mixture of Chemical, Electrical and

Mechanical Engineering but in the 10^-9 scale!


Because of my programs multidisciplinary nature I am taught a wide variety of skills

as you can see from my CAD work, LABs, and the classes I take. On top of classes

I am/was involved in <b>varsity Fencing</b>, video editing for WhatsNano, <b>Waterloo rocketry </b>

and <b>UW Orbital</b> design team as a payload sub-team member.  

 

I hope you enjoy my website as much as I enjoyed making it. </pre> </p>

                        As a group we were tasked to design, construct, and test a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The end goal
                    for the STM is to measure a sustainable tunneling current using simple materials. We constructed the STM in 4 stages: 
                     dividing a unimorph piezo disc into four quarters,<b> build</b> a isolation and damping encolsure first using <b>CAD</b> and then using the <b>Machine shop</b> tools and limited materials, 
                    build and test the current amplifier<b></b> circuit, <b></b>electrochemical etching to create an STM tip and<b></b> MATLAB used to analyze, filter and display the data collected.

                     The lab required the class to produce 3 different bioplastic recipes: gelitine, agar, and another plastic. Then we compaired each bioplastic to each other
             and to an actual plastic based on tensile strength using the <b>tensile strength Machine</b>. Afterwards tensile strength data was collected, plotted and analyzed on <b>Excel</b>.

                    As a group we were tasked to design, construct, and test a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The end goal
                    for the STM is to measure a sustainable tunneling current using simple materials. We constructed the STM in 4 stages: 
                     dividing a unimorph piezo disc into four quarters,<b> build</b> a isolation and damping encolsure first using <b>CAD</b> and then using the <b>Machine shop</b> tools and limited materials, 
                    build and test the current amplifier<b></b> circuit, <b></b>electrochemical etching to create an STM tip and<b></b> MATLAB used to analyze, filter and display the data collected.

                         The lab required the class to produce 3 different bioplastic recipes: gelitine, agar, and another plastic. 
                         Then we compaired each bioplastic to each other
             and to an actual plastic based on tensile strength using the <b>tensile strength Machine</b>. 
             Afterwards tensile strength data was collected, plotted and analyzed on <b>Excel</b>.
